If you havin' girl problems I feel bad for you son
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one - hit me!

Got 'em Mike

He's got the Rap Patrol on the gat patrol
Foes that wanna make sure his casket's closed
Rap critics that say he's "Money, Cash, Hoes"
He's from the hood stupid, what type of facts are those?
If you grew up with holes in your zapatos
You'd celebrate the minute you was havin' dough
So f*ck critics, you can kiss the whole asshole
If you don't like the lyrics, you can press fast forward
Got beef with radio if we don't play they show
They don't play our hits, we don't give a shit, so!
All these mags try and use our ass
So advertisers can give 'em more cash for ads, fuckers!
I don't know what you take us as
Or understand the intelligence that Jay-Z has
From, rags to riches, we ain't dumb
We got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one - hit me!

99 problems, but a bitch ain't one
If you havin' girl problems I feel bad for you son
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one - hit me!

Now the year is ninety-four, in my trunk is raw
In the rear view mirror is the motherfuckin' law
I got two choices y'all, pull over the car or (or?)
Bounce on the Devil, put the pedal to the floor (c'mon!)
And I ain't tryin' to see no highway chase with Jake
Plus I got a few dollars, I can fight the case
So I, pull over to the side of the road
I heard "Son, do you know why I'm stoppin' you for?"
Cause I'm young and I'm black and my hat's real low
Or do I look like a mind reader sir? I don't know
Am I under arrest or should I guess some mo'?
(Well you was doin' fifty-five in the fifty-four
License and registration and step out of the car
Are you carryin' a weapon on you? I know a lot of you are)
I ain't steppin' out of shit, all my papers legit
(Well do you mind if I look around the car a little bit?)
Well my glove compartment is locked, so is the trunk in the back
And I know my rights, so you gon' need a warrant for that
(Aren't you sharp as a tack!
You some type of lawyer or something?
Somebody important or somethin'?)
Ha, I ain't passed the bar, but I know a little bit
Enough that you won't illegally search my shit
(Well we'll see how smart you are when the canines come)
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one - hit me!

One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time all I know
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away, it's so unreal (It's so unreal)
Didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Tryin' to hold on, didn't even know
I wasted it all just to watch you go

Why does it feel like night today?
Somethin' in here's not right today
Why am I so uptight today?
Paranoia's all I got left
I don't know what stressed me first
Or how the pressure was fed
But I know just what it feels like
To have a voice in the back of my head
Like a face that I hold inside
A face that awakes when I close my eyes
A face watches every time I lie
A face that laughs every time I fall
(And watches everything)
So I know that when it's time to sink or swim
That the face inside is here in me
Right underneath my skin
It's like I'm paranoid lookin' over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin
I know I've got a face in me
Points out all my mistakes to me
You've got a face on the inside too
And your paranoia's probably worse
I don't know what set me off first
But I know what I can't stand
Everybody acts like the fact of the matter is
I can't add up to what you can
But everybody has a face that they hold inside
A face that awakes when I close my eyes
A face watches every time they lie
A face that laughs every time they fall
(And watches everything)
So you know that when it's time to sink or swim
That the face inside is watchin' you too
Right inside your skin
It's like I'm paranoid lookin' over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like the face inside is right beneath the skin
It's like I'm paranoid lookin' over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin
The face inside is right beneath your skin
The face inside is right beneath your skin
The face inside is right beneath your skin
The sun goes down
I feel the light betray me
The sun goes down
I feel the light betray me
It's like I'm paranoid lookin' over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like the face inside is right beneath the skin
It's like I'm paranoid lookin' over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin

Crawling in my skin
These wounds, they will not heal
Fear is how I fall
Confusing what is real
There's something inside me that pulls beneath the surface
Consuming, confusing
This lack of self control I fear is never ending
Controlling
I can't seem
To find myself again
My walls are closing in
(Without a sense of confidence, I'm convinced)
(That there's just too much pressure to take)
I've felt this way before
So insecure
Crawling in my skin
These wounds, they will not heal
Fear is how I fall
Confusing what is real
Discomfort, endlessly has pulled itself upon me
Distracting, reacting
Against my will I stand beside my own reflection
It's haunting
How I can't seem
To find myself again
My walls are closing in
(Without a sense of confidence, I'm convinced)
(That there's just too much pressure to take)
I've felt this way before
So insecure
Crawling in my skin
These wounds, they will not heal
Fear is how I fall
Confusing what is real
Crawling in my skin
These wounds, they will not heal
Fear is how I fall
Confusing, confusing what is real
There's something inside me that pulls beneath the surface
Consuming (confusing what is real)
This lack of self control I fear is never ending
Controlling (confusing what is real)

I cannot take this anymore
Saying everything I've said before
All these words, they make no sense
I find bliss in ignorance
Less I hear, the less you say
You'll find that out anyway
Just like before
Everything you say to me
(Takes me one step closer to the edge)
(And I'm about to break)
I need a little room to breathe
('Cause I'm one step closer to the edge)
(I'm about to break)
I find the answers aren't so clear
Wish I could find a way to disappear
All these thoughts they make no sense
I find bliss in ignorance
Nothing seems to go away
Over and over again
Just like before
Everything you say to me
(Takes me one step closer to the edge)
(And I'm about to break)
I need a little room to breathe
('Cause I'm one step closer to the edge)
(I'm about to break)
Everything you say to me
(Takes me one step closer to the edge)
(And I'm about to break)
I need a little room to breathe
('Cause I'm one step closer to the edge)
(And I'm about to-)
Break, break, break...
Shut up when I'm talking to you
Shut up, shut up, shut up
Shut up when I'm talking to you
Shut up, shut up, shut up
Shut up
I'm about to break
Everything you say to me
(Takes me one step closer to the edge)
(And I'm about to break)
I need a little room to breathe
('Cause I'm one step closer to the edge)
(I'm about to break)
Everything you say to me
(Takes me one step closer to the edge)
(And I'm about to break)
I need a little room to breathe
('Cause I'm one step closer to the edge)
(And I'm about to)
Break
